							<p>The Earth is slowly getting hotter because of the way humans live. Some of the things we do, like driving cars and making energy, release gases like carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere which traps the Sun's heat, creating a greenhouse effect. The warming of the Earth leads to extreme weather and rising sea levels, causing problems for humans and animals.</p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">Greenhouses</h2>
							<p>A greenhouse works by trapping heat to create warmer conditions for growing plants. The same thing happens when we release carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. In the day, the Sun’s rays warm the Earth. At night Earth cools again as warmth escapes out of the atmosphere. But gases like carbon dioxide trap the heat in our atmosphere. Over many years, this slowly warms our Earth.</p>
							<p>The increase in greenhouse gases is mostly caused by:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>burning fossil fuels to make energy and power cars</li>
								<li>farming animals</li>
								<li>the cutting down of trees known as deforestation</li>
								<li>making things which we call manufacturing</li>
							</ul>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">What does this mean?</h2>
							<p>Increasing temperatures on Earth cause more extreme weather events, like floods and fires. Carbon dioxide makes our oceans more acidic which kills sea life and pollutes their environment. Gases also pollute the air we breathe. </p>
							<p>As the sea warms, the ice at both poles melts, destroying the habitat of animals like polar bears. And causes sea levels to rise, risking coastal communities and more flooding. </p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">What does this mean?</h2>
							<p>If humans everywhere do the right thing, we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we produce. People might tell you one person can’t make a difference because climate change is too big. But if enough people change how they live, we can make a huge difference. </p>
							<p>This is your Earth and your future. Don’t wait for adults to save it. Here are 5 things you can do to help stop climate change.</p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">1. Think about how you travel </h2>
							<p>Driving everywhere isn’t good for the Earth. Cars release carbon dioxide. Driving is comfortable and easy, so people choose to drive even short distances instead of walk. But because of the convenience of driving, people don’t think about the effect driving a car has on our Earth. </p>
							<p>You can do a lot by reminding people about this. And encouraging your parents and friends to walk, cycle or take public transport instead of drive. Not only is walking and cycling better for the environment, it is better for your health. Being healthy makes us happy. And the Earth will be happier too.</p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">2. Use less energy</h2>
							<p>Lots of the things we rely on need energy to work. TVs, computers, lights and smartphones all use electricity. More and more of the energy we use is available from green, sustainable sources like wind and solar. But we are still reliant on burning fossil fuels to make a lot of our electricity.</p>
							<p>In the United States in 2018, creating electricity relied mostly on fossil fuels. And this accounted for nearly over 28% of the greenhouse gases produced by the United States (1).</p>
							<p>We can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases by encouraging our parents to buy their electricity from green providers. We can also make sure we turn off things we are not using like lights and tvs. And putting on a jumper instead of putting the heating on.</p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">3. Eat less meat</h2>
							<p>Meat production has the single biggest impact on the environment. Not only that but making products from animals like milk and cheese also emits considerably more greenhouse gases then producing foods like cereals and vegetables.</p>
							<p>You can achieve an amazing amount by changing your diet in a small way. If you and others can reduce the amount of food you eat that came from animals you can . And encouraging others to do the same.</p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">4. Don’t buy things you don’t need</h2>
							<p>Buying less things saves you money and also reduces the amount of greenhouse gases sent into the atmosphere. Everything you own and buy has to be made. Companies making things have to collect materials like metal and plastic. They then have to manufacture the materials together to make the thing. And then they package it up in more plastic or cardboard to sell in shops. Every stage of this ‘manufacturing’ process uses energy and results in greenhouse gases.</p>
							<p>The average 10 year old in the UK owns 238 toys but only plays with 12 (2). You can make better choices by having only what you need. And choosing sustainable products to buy from companies that care about climate change.</p>

							<p>If you follow these steps, you can do your bit to stop climate change. But you can achieve even more by getting your friends and family involved. If you act differently, others will ask you why. Tell them and encourage them to do the same.</p>
							<p>You can also go bigger and tell your countries leaders that climate change matters. Children have as much of a voice as adults. </p>
