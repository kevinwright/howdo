							<p>The Earth is slowly getting hotter because of the way humans live. This is known as climate change. Some of the things we do, like driving cars and making energy, releases gases like carbon dioxide into the Earth's atmosphere. These gases trap the Sun's heat, creating a greenhouse effect. The warming of the Earth leads to extreme weather and rising sea levels, causing problems for humans and wildlife. </p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">Greenhouse effect</h2>
							<p>A greenhouse works by trapping heat to create warmer conditions for growing plants. The same thing happens when we release gases like carbon dioxide into our atmosphere. In the day, the Sun’s rays warm the Earth. At night Earth should cool again as warmth escapes out of the atmosphere. But greenhouse gases trap heat in our atmosphere which, over many years, slowly warms our Earth. </p>
							<p>Greenhouse gases are mostly caused by:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>burning fossil fuels to power our homes and cars</li>
								<li>farming animals</li>
								<li>the cutting down of trees known as deforestation</li>
								<li>making things which we call manufacturing</li>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">What does this mean?</h2>
							<p>Rising temperatures on Earth cause extreme weather events, like floods and fires.</p>
							<p>As the sea warms, the ice at both poles melts, destroying the habitat of animals and causing sea levels to rise, risking coastal communities and more flooding.</p>
							<p>Carbon dioxide also makes our oceans more acidic which kills sea life and pollutes their environment. Likewise, gases can pollute the air we breathe, too. </p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">We can stop climate change</h2>
							<p>If humans everywhere do the right thing, we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases we produce. You might think that one person can’t make a difference to something as big as climate change. But if enough people change how they live, we can make a huge difference.</p>
							<p>This is your Earth and your future. Here are 5 things you can do to protect it against climate change.</p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">1. Think about how you travel </h2>
							<p>Driving is comfortable and easy, so people choose to drive even short distances instead of walking. But people don’t think about the effect cars have on our Earth. Cars releasing carbon dioxide is a major cause of greenhouse gases, so driving everywhere isn’t good for the Earth.</p>
							<p>You can do a lot by reminding people about this, and encouraging your parents and friends to walk, cycle or take public transport instead of driving. Not only is walking and cycling better for the environment, it is better for your health. Being healthy makes us happy. And the Earth will be happier too.</p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">2. Use less energy</h2>
							<p>Lots of the things we use in our day to day lives need energy to work. TVs, computers, lights and smartphones all use electricity. More and more of the energy we use is available from green, sustainable sources like wind and solar. But we are still reliant on burning fossil fuels to make a lot of our electricity. </p>
							<p>In the United States in 2018, creating electricity relied mostly on fossil fuels. This accounted for over 28% of the greenhouse gases produced by the United States in the last year <span><a href="#">(1)</a></span>.</p>
							<p>You can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases by encouraging your parents to buy their electricity from green providers. You can also help by turning off the things you are not using, like lights and TVs, to save electricity. </p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">3. Eat less meat</h2>
							<p>Meat production and farming has the single biggest impact on the environment. And it’s not only about the amount of meat we eat. Making products that come from animals, like milk and cheese, emits far more greenhouse gases than producing foods like cereals and vegetables. </p>
							<p>You can achieve an amazing amount by changing your diet in a small way and encouraging others to do the same. For example, you could choose only to eat meat or diary at weekends.</p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">4. Don’t buy things you don’t need</h2>
							<p>Buying only the things you need saves you money and also reduces the amount of greenhouse gases sent into the atmosphere. Everything you own and buy has to be manufactured. Every stage of the manufacturing process uses energy and results in greenhouse gases.</p>
							<p>Companies who make things have to collect materials like metal and plastic. They have to manufacture these materials to make them into the things we buy. And then they package these products up in more plastic or cardboard to sell, and deliver it in fossil fuel powered vehicles.</p>
							<p>The average 10 year old in the UK owns 238 toys but only plays with 12 <span><a href="#">(2)</a></span>. You can make better choices by having only what you need. And choosing sustainable products to buy from companies that care about climate change.</p>

							<h2 class="heading-medium">5. Make some noise</h2>
							<p>If you follow these steps, you can do your bit to stop climate change. But you can achieve even more by getting your friends and family involved. If you act differently, others will ask you why. Tell them and encourage them to do the same.</p>
							<p>You can also go bigger and tell your country’s leaders that climate change matters to you. Children can make as much noise as adults to make the world a better place. In the UK for example, you can <a href="#">write to your MP</a> (your representative in Parliament) about climate change.</p>
