					<p>Websites are made up of words, images, and videos, all bundled up in files. The computer where these files are stored could be anywhere in the world, but your computer can still talk to it. This is because they’re both connected to the Internet.</p>
					<p>When you type in a web address (like <a href="www.bbc.co.uk/newsround">www.bbc.co.uk/newsround</a>), your computer is sent all the files by cables or wirelessly. Your computer shows all these files to you in a way that is easy to view.</p>

							<p>I open up the browser on my iPad. My browser is a app. And it is really good at reading website data. </p>
							<p>Most websites are written in a language called hypertext markup language - most people refer to it as HTML.</p>
							<p>Using HTML, people give meaning to the words they write by tagging them. This helps the computer understand them. For example in HTML, you can put a &#x3C;p&#x3E; tag around words. This tells a computer that this is a paragraph of text. </p>

							<p>There is a computer somewhere in the world that holds all the files for Wikipedia. Maybe it’s in America. As soon as I press enter, my iPad will send a message to this computer asking for all the files it needs to show Wikipedia’s front page…</p>

							<p>When I hit enter, my iPad asked the other computer for the Wikipedia files. They can talk to each other because they’re both connected to the internet – a worldwide network of computers, phones, cables, switches and other connected things. </p>
							<p>My iPad knows where to send the request because everything connected to the internet has its own address – called an IP address.</p>
							<p>When the Wikipedia computer (which is called a server) receives the request, it grabs all the files and send them back.</p>
							<p>My browser then takes those files, and figures out how to display them all.</p>
