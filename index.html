							<h1 class="heading-large">Cycle and walk</h1>
							<p>Ever looked around at cars on the road on your way to work and noticed how most only have one person inside. Imagine replacing all those car journeys with bikes or pedestrians.</p>
							<p>It's easy to cycle or walk instead of driving. You don't even have to do it all the time.</p>
							<p>The benefits are staggering. Less traffic on the roads. You get healthier and fitter - which puts less strain on the health services. Oh and you save money.</p>

							<h1 class="heading-large">Recycle... more</h1>
							<p>Most of us recycle. There are so many things to recycle. Food that gets turned back into energy. Metal that gets turned into something (helpful).</p>
							<p>But we can all do more. Don't throw away yogurt cups. Wash them. Try recycling the coffee grounds from pods if you use them.</p>
							<p>Which all makes your bin bags lighter to carry.</p>

							<p>8 million tonnes of plastic finds its way in the oceans each year (Dr. J. Jambeck).</p>
							<p>Thats a lot. Helping reduce this is really easy. Stop drinking out of plastic bottles. Buy a proper water bottle. Thats it.</p>
							<p>Stay highdrated and stop using shit you don't need.</p>

							<h1 class="heading-large">Less stuff. More knowledge</h1>
							<p>Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia fishes with one type of kit. He says it gets him the best results because he focused on how to use it properly. If you want to cycle faster, do you need a new bike or do you need to learn to cycle more efficiently.</p>
							<p>All the time we're told we need new because its better. But that rubbish. Consumerism hurts the planet and hurts your wallet. Less is sometimes more.</p>

							<h1 class="heading-large">Weekday vegetarian</h1>
							<p>Meat production is doing the most damage to our planet.</p>
							<p>Becoming a vegetarian isn't for everyone. But it's easy to avoid meat in the week and keep it as a weekend treat. It's healthier, saves you money and helps you stay trim.</p>
