					<h1 class="heading-large">Cycle and walk</h1>
					<h2 class="heading-xlarge">#1</h2>
					<p>Ever looked around at cars on the road on your way to work and noticed how 90% only have one person. Imagine replacing all those one person car journeys with bikes or pedestrians.</p>
					<p>This is easy. Cycle or walk instead of driving. You don't even have to do it all the time.</p>
					<p>The benefits are staggering. Less traffic. Healthier people - which leads to less strain on our health services. Saving money.</p>

					<h1 class="heading-large">Recycle... more</h1>
					<h2 class="heading-xlarge">#2</h2>
					<p>Most of us recycle. There are so many things to recycle. Food that gets turned back into energy. Metal that gets turned into something (helpful).</p>
					<p>But we can all do more. Don't throw yogurt cups. Wash them. You can also recycle the coffee grounds from pods if you use them.</p>
					<p>So many positives. And it makes way lighter bin bags to carry up the drive.</p>

					<h1 class="heading-large">Weekday vegetarian</h1>
					<h2 class="heading-xlarge">#5</h2>
					<p>Meat production is doing the most damage to our planet.</p>
					<p>Becoming a full on vegetarian isn't for everyone. But it's easy to avoid meat in the week and keep it as a weekend treat. It's healthier, saves you money and helps you stay trim.</p>
