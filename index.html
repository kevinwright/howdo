			<p>HowDo is built on a simple idea.</p>
			<p>Children are often told or feel that they can't do things because of their gender or intelligence. The things we’re told and learn as children leave a mark. If a child is told by a teacher that they are lazy, they will carry that ‘tag’ with them for years. </p>
			<p>Science, technology, engineering and maths make up the STEM subjects. They are  some of the most important and interesting subjects that children will learn. But they can be unaccessible - hard to understand and weighted towards boys.</p>
			<p>HowDo explains these subjects to children in a way that is accessible and easy to understand. Whatever their gender or ability, we hope children will be engaged and fascinated by how things in our world work.</p>
